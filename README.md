Examples and Instructions for IOP Docker Lab

## Install Docker Toolbox for Windows
Download and install [Docker Toolbox](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v1.12.5/DockerToolbox-1.12.5.exe). If there are any issues during installation, see [the installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/#step-2-install-docker-toolbox).

Once installed, you should have "Docker Quickstart" available on your desktop. Open this to generate a virtual machine called "default" (aka docker-machine).

Once the "default" docker-machine has been created, you can use it at any point from Docker Quickstart, CMD, or PowerShell.
